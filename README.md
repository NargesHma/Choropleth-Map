# Choropleth-Map
## Visualizing data on map with python libraries (pandas, geopandas, folium)

The Choropleth-Map is a powerful tool for visualizing data on geographical maps using Python libraries such as Pandas, GeoPandas, and Folium. This method allows businesses operating across various regions, from countries to cities and counties, to gain valuable insights from their data.

Imagine your business spans across different regions, and you seek insights into customer distribution, vendor locations, or other geographical patterns. With the aid of this Jupyter notebook, you can effortlessly apply your data to visualize it on a map, facilitating a deeper understanding of your customer base, vendor networks, and more.

The provided Jupyter notebook demonstrates this process using a sample Excel file named **"Customers data"** with latitude and longitude coordinates corresponding to locations in Iran. However, you can easily adapt the script to visualize data from any region by simply providing the appropriate map file.

I employ two methods to present the data: utilizing Folium's choropleth function and a manual approach. Here is the choropleth output:

Two map files are loaded within the notebook:

**gadm41_IRN_1**: Contains only the provinces of Iran.

**gadm41_IRN_2**: Includes both provinces and cities of Iran, offering a more detailed view of the geographical landscape.

By leveraging these tools and datasets, businesses can gain valuable insights into regional trends, distribution patterns, and demographic variations, empowering more informed decision-making processes.
